## R Scripts to Demonstrate Use of AQP and Related Packages to Visualize Soils Data

This repository contains files for sample R scripts to be used in Geography/Soil Science 525 (Soil Geomorphology). Students will access the scripts through Binder. The scripts used here are adapted from scripts by Dylan Beaudette and available on the Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology website. http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/
